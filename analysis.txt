Part 2:
  Q3: 
    We ran ./mm 1024 1024 1024 and had the following results: (1) 16.9923s
    (2) 61.102s (3) 60.9968s (4) 61.3216s (5) 61.7574
    We are not sure why we recorded such a small value the first run through but based on this data the naive version either runs at _____Gflops/s for the 16.99s run through or _____Gflops/s for the average of the others (~61.29s)
